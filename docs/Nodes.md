# Nodes

This project builds a graph based on a precice-config.xml file. The nodes in the graph correspond to the specified XML
elements and tags.<br>
The documentation for preCICE's config tags can be read
at [preCICE XML reference](https://precice.org/configuration-XML-reference.html)

> [!NOTE]
> This graph is built for the [preCICE logic checker](https://github.com/precice-forschungsprojekt/config-checker). This
> means that there may be redundancies or “inconsistencies” in the building of the graph itself.

Here you will find a list with brief explanations of each node and its parameters.
